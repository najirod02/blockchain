all the commands used to create and run a node can be seen in their respective shell files.

after running the nodes, it is possible to connect to them by typing:

geth attach http://localhost:<node_port>


after getting access to the node, it is possible to query it to obtain
some information, for example:

admin.nodeInfo # the details of the node

admin.peers # the details of peer nodes

admin.addPeer('ENODE_ADDRESS_OF_PEER') # to manually add a new peer

clique.getSigners() # get list of signers

eth.sendTransaction(
{
from: "0xENODE_ADDRESS",
to:"0xENODE_ADDRESS",
value: "how_much"
}
) # send transaction from onw to another node

eth.getTransaction("0xTRANSACTION_ADDRESS") # print transaction's info
